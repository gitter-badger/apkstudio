Instructions:
--------
- Make sure **JAVA_HOME** point to a valid **JDK** (*JRE* may not work)
- You should also install or have **ADB** in *PATH*. This can be done on debian{-based} distros as follows:
```bash
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb
```
- Also make sure you've **zipalign** installed. If it's not then issue the command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install zipalign
```
- You can then download, install & start de/re-compiling

**Note**: If you encounter any problems, make sure to check **Console Output** at bottom of IDE to get the output of command which was actually executed by program.
